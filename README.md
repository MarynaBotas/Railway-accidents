# CF-Railway-accidents
For the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program project, I built an interactive dashboard to visually present the results of an advanced exploratory analysis in Python of railroad accidents in the U.S. from 1975 to 2022. The final report details the analysis process, highlights key findings, and demonstrates the capabilities of the interactive dashboard to stakeholders.

## Objective
In my study project, I conducted an advanced exploratory analysis of railway accidents in the USA from 1975 to 2022. This analysis addresses key questions such as which states report the highest number of incidents, the most frequent types of incidents, and their relationship to injuries and financial losses. It also examines trends in accident frequency over the years and the factors most often involved in accidents, such as train speed and season of the year. The project includes visualizations, geospatial analysis, regression, clustering, and time-series analysis, with detailed notebooks available on GitHub.

## Key Questions
•	Which states report the highest number of railway incidents? 

•	What are the most frequent types of reported railway incidents? Are the most common types of rail incidents also the cause of the highest number of injuries and financial losses?

•	What factors such as train speed, visibility or weather conditions are most often involved in rail accidents?

•	How have the number of railway incidents changed over the years from 1975 to 2022? Are there any noticeable trends in incident frequency?


## Data and Tools
The Railway Incident Dataset, published by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Railroad Safety, provides comprehensive data on railway incidents from 1975 to 2022. 

The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle via the following link: [Railroad Accident & Incident Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrico03/railroad-accident-and-incident-data)

This dataset is licensed under the public domain license available at http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/.

Using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda library manager, I completed the analysis with Python and relevant libraries such as pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, pylab, and statsmodels.api. The detailed notebooks are available [here](https://github.com/MarynaBotas/Railway-accidents/tree/main/Scripts)

Visualizations and the final dashboard were created using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/RailwayaccidentsintheUSA1975to2022/RailwayaccidentsintheUSA1975to2022?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
